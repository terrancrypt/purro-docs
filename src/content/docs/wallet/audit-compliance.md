title: Audit & Compliance
description: Security reviews, open-source posture, and responsible disclosure.
---

## Security Reviews
- Internal static checks: TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier
- Automated tests for storage, encryption, provider, and transactions
- Third‑party audit before public store release (auditor TBA)
- Post‑launch monitoring and hotfix releases

## Open Source
- Core extension planned for open-source (MIT/Apache-2.0)
- Public review of sensitive logic and developer contributions welcomed
- Versioned API docs and SDK references maintained

## Compliance Posture
- Non‑custodial wallet; keys and data stored locally
- No centralized custody, KYC, or seed transmission
- Privacy‑aligned by design; per‑origin permissions and explicit user consent

## Responsible Disclosure
- Report via security channels (email and repository issues)
- Issues triaged with versioned fixes and documented timelines
