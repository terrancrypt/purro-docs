Purro is a native-first, multichain-ready wallet designed for the Hyperliquid and HyperEVM ecosystems. It focuses on low-friction onboarding, clear signing, and deep ecosystem integration rather than generic multi-chain breadth.

- Optimized for Hyperliquid and HyperEVM from day one
- Gasless, intent-aware user flows (swaps, bridging)
- Human-readable signing with EIP-712
- Built-in identity via Hyperliquid Names (e.g., `@user.purro`)
- Developer-first SDKs and EVM provider compatibility

Purro provides a consistent, fast, and safe experience for traders, builders, and power usersâ€”without requiring manual gas management or network juggling.
