title: Transfers via Hyperliquid Names
description: Send and receive using @names instead of addresses.
---

Purro integrates Hyperliquid Names to simplify transfers and reduce errors.

- Use `@handle` formats (e.g., `@trader.purro`) when available
- Resolve names to addresses before sending
- Safer, more readable UX for everyday use

Developers can access name resolution via the Purro SDK for consistent behavior across dApps.
