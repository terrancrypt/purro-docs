title: NFT & Identity Layer
description: Programmable identity and utility integrated into the wallet UX.
---

Purro includes an NFT-based identity system to drive utility and recognition.

## Goals
- Personalization via traits and accessories
- Utility unlocks (feature passes, fee discounts, boosts)
- Onchain reputation for participation and milestones

## Seasonal Structure
- Core character sets with accessory drops
- Trait-linked benefits (e.g., multipliers, access)
- Snapshot-based eligibility and dynamic claim pages

## Genesis Drop (Planned)
- Deployed natively on Hyperliquid NFT infra in partnership with ecosystem teams
- Free mint for early users: top swap users, vePURRO lockers, testnet contributors
- Mint directly in-wallet with native rendering; metadata includes activity signals

## Technical Notes
- Standards: ERC-721 / ERC-1155 on HyperEVM
- Claims: Merkle eligibility; optional gas subsidy
- Rendering: Native in-wallet, with planned support for animated/dynamic overlays

## Long-Term Direction
- Trait evolution tied to onchain activity
- Soulbound achievements for governance or community milestones
- Quest-based unlocks and partner utilities across dApps
