title: Smart Wallet (Account Abstraction)
description: Upcoming module for session keys, gas abstraction, and programmable accounts.
---

The Smart Wallet module introduces account abstraction (AA) for advanced UX while preserving non-custodial control.

## Planned Capabilities
- Session keys for smooth multi-step dApp interactions
- Gas abstraction via relayers/paymasters (pay in USDC/HYPE/others)
- Batched actions (approve + swap + bridge)
- Social recovery and programmable permissions

Standards alignment: EIP-4337 (AA), EIP-1271 (signature validation), deterministic deployment (CREATE2).

Availability: planned as an optional module; existing EOA flows remain supported.
