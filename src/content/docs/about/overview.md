description: Purpose-built wallet for Hyperliquid and HyperEVM with a native-first UX.
---

Purro is a native-first wallet crafted for the Hyperliquid and HyperEVM ecosystems. We focus on practical UX, developer enablement, and deep protocol alignment rather than generic multi-chain checklists.

- Intent-aware UX: clear, contextual signing and gasless workflows
- Ecosystem-native: Hyperliquid Names, one-click bridging, and reliable swaps
- Builder-first: standards-compliant provider and SDK modules
- Multichain-ready: designed to extend to Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana, and Sui

Our goal is to make Hyper-native interactions fast, safe, and understandable—for traders, developers, and power users.

## Executive Summary
Purro is a frictionless liquidity access layer for Hyperliquid + HyperEVM—not just a key manager. Built on Alchemy infra and Hyper-native primitives (names, gasless flows), Purro prioritizes intent-driven UX and developer extensibility.

## Market Landscape
Hyperliquid is evolving into a full-stack DeFi OS with HyperEVM. The backend is strong; the shared UX front door is missing. Purro defines a standard for "Hyper-native UX" to reduce drop-off and align incentives.

## The Wallet Gap Today
- Scattered balances across L1/L2; poor visibility
- Gas token complexity (HYPE) and manual bridging
- Web2-unfriendly onboarding and blind signing
- Fragmented DEX UX across multiple tabs
- Limited incentives for early, high-intent usage

Purro addresses this via gasless onboarding, contextual signatures, native swap/bridge, and transparent rebates.

## Purro’s Positioning
Designed for Hyper. Built for scale. Purro respects Hyperliquid’s architecture, extends composability to the user surface, and brings native onboarding and incentives across the ecosystem.

## Ecosystem Alignment
1) Drive onchain volume with native swap/bridge and rebates. 2) Lower entry barriers with gasless onboarding. 3) Provide wallet infra (SDK) for HyperEVM apps. 4) Nudge liquidity into HyperEVM via one-click routing. 5) Apply multichain playbooks where relevant. 6) Use gasless design as a growth engine.

## Go-To-Market Strategy
- Ecosystem-first integration with Hyperliquid
- Developer flywheel: SDK, WalletConnect, fee sharing, bounties
- Targeted onboarding: 40% rebates (up to 50% tier), referrals, walkthroughs
- Co-marketing with ecosystem partners; docs placement and tutorials

## Governance & Community
Progressive decentralization as scale and PMF mature. Contribution channels: feature proposals, bugs/security, SDK/plugins, and testing waves. Future onchain governance (optional) for fees, rebates, and partner programs.

## Competitive Landscape
- MetaMask/Rabby: generic EVM; manual networks/gas; limited Hyper-native UX
- Phantom: Solana-first; early Hyper perps but lacks broader Hyper UX
- Okto: Hyper-leaning; mobile-first with limited dev extensibility

Purro focuses on native, programmable UX with gas abstraction, identity, and cross-surface continuity.
