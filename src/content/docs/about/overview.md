title: About Purro
description: Purpose-built wallet for Hyperliquid and HyperEVM with a native-first UX.
---

Purro is a native-first wallet crafted for the Hyperliquid and HyperEVM ecosystems. We focus on practical UX, developer enablement, and deep protocol alignment rather than generic multi-chain checklists.

- Intent-aware UX: clear, contextual signing and gasless workflows
- Ecosystem-native: Hyperliquid Names, one-click bridging, and reliable swaps
- Builder-first: standards-compliant provider and SDK modules
- Multichain-ready: designed to extend to Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana, and Sui

Our goal is to make Hyper-native interactions fast, safe, and understandableâ€”for traders, developers, and power users.
