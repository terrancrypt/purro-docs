## HyperEVM API Limitations & HyperScan Integration

### üö® Current Technical Constraints

#### HyperEVM API Services Missing
HyperEVM currently lacks many essential API services required for comprehensive integration:

**‚ùå Missing API Services:**
- **Token Metadata API** - Detailed token information (decimals, symbol, name)
- **Price Feed API** - Real-time token prices
- **Gas Estimation API** - Transaction gas estimation
- **Block Information API** - Block and confirmation data
- **Contract Interaction API** - Smart contract method calls
- **Event Logs API** - Smart contract event logs
- **DeFi Protocol APIs** - LiquidSwap, HyperSwap integrations
- **Portfolio Analytics API** - Portfolio analysis and performance

**‚úÖ Available API Services:**
- Basic transaction history
- Basic token balances
- Basic NFT information
- Basic address information

#### Current API Integration Status

**‚úÖ Alchemy SDK Integration (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base)**
Purro extension currently uses Alchemy SDK for comprehensive blockchain data on supported networks:
- **Ethereum Mainnet** - Full Alchemy integration with complete APIs
- **Arbitrum One** - Full Alchemy integration with complete APIs  
- **Base Mainnet** - Full Alchemy integration with complete APIs

**‚ö†Ô∏è HyperScan Integration (HyperEVM - Temporary Solution)**
Due to HyperEVM API limitations, Purro extension currently uses HyperScan API as a workaround for HyperEVM data:

**HyperScan Services Used for HyperEVM:**
- Token balance fetching
- NFT collection data
- Transaction history
- Token transfer events
- NFT instance details

**Future Alchemy Integration for HyperEVM:**
- Comprehensive token metadata
- Advanced NFT APIs
- Real-time data feeds
- Enhanced transaction analytics
- Cross-chain portfolio management

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HyperScan Rate Limiting Issues

**Rate Limits:**
- **Free Tier**: 10 requests/minute
- **Basic Tier**: 100 requests/minute
- **Pro Tier**: 1000 requests/minute

**Impact on User Experience:**
- **Slow loading times** - Must wait between requests
- **Incomplete data** - Cannot load all data simultaneously
- **Poor UX** - Users need to refresh multiple times
- **Limited functionality** - Cannot implement real-time features

**Current Mitigation:**
- **Caching Strategy**: 10-minute cache for token data
- **Request Queuing**: Sequential API calls to avoid rate limits
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when limits are hit

### üéØ Migration Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Immediate Optimizations (In Progress)
- [ ] **Enhanced caching** - Increase cache time and optimize strategy
- [ ] **Request queuing** - Queue requests to avoid rate limits
- [ ] **Fallback APIs** - Multiple data sources
- [ ] **Offline support** - Local data caching

#### Phase 2: Alchemy API Integration (Planned)
- [ ] **Extend Alchemy SDK** - Add HyperEVM support to existing Alchemy integration
- [ ] **Migration planning** - Prepare transition from HyperScan to Alchemy
- [ ] **Hybrid approach** - Use both Alchemy and HyperScan during transition
- [ ] **API health monitoring** - Monitor service availability

#### Phase 3: Full Alchemy Integration (Future)
- [ ] **Complete Alchemy integration** - Full Alchemy API adoption for HyperEVM
- [ ] **Remove HyperScan dependency** - Eliminate HyperScan reliance
- [ ] **Performance optimization** - Optimize with Alchemy's comprehensive APIs
- [ ] **Advanced features** - Enhanced functionality with Alchemy's tools

### üìä Performance Comparison

| Metric            | HyperScan (Current) | Alchemy (Target) |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Rate Limit        | 10-1000 req/min     | 330 req/sec      |
| Response Time     | 200-500ms           | 50-100ms         |
| Data Completeness | Partial             | Complete         |
| Real-time Support | Limited             | Full             |
| Cost              | Free/Paid           | Free tier + paid |
| API Coverage      | Basic blockchain    | Comprehensive    |
| Token Metadata    | Limited             | Full support     |
| NFT Support       | Basic               | Advanced         |
